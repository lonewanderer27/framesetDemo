        <i><h2>Hobbies and Interest</h2></i>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 30%;">I am a nerd, someone that is highly interested in computers in general. My hobbies are drawing, photo and video editing. Anything digital is interesting for me. I'm also huge KPOP fan and I stan a lot of groups. In terms of sports, I only have one which is badminton, apart from that I have none. I do little to none physical activity as my focus is inside my mind, I think a lot, that alone is already an exhausting activity and might be the reason why I am fit even if I don't exercise.
